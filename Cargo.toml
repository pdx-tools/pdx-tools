# We override the test profile so that our tests run in a tolerable time as
# some of the asset files are heavyweight and can take a significant amount of
# time. Here is some timing data recorded to run one test:
#
# cargo test                 0m15.037s
# cargo test (opt-level=3)   0m9.644s
# cargo test (+lto=thin)     0m0.907s
# cargo test --release       0m0.620s
